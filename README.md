# HangMan

### What's goin on GITHUB?! How y'all doin tonight?

### Who's ready to play that big hangman, ahhhh??

![ali g provides a serious look to let us know what this game is about](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/ip_2834046.jpg)

This is a game about life and death.  If you guess the right words, you live.  If not, you die, but can come back to play again.  It's a game of trial and challenge, love and loss, and most of all - the will with words to woo the world.  Win, my friend.  Win.

Thank you.
